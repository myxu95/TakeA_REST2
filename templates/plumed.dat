# PLUMED template for REST2 simulations
# This file will be combined with REST2 PARTIAL_TEMPERING command

# Output frequency
PRINT STRIDE=5000 FILE=COLVAR

# Example: Distance between two atoms (uncomment and modify as needed)
# DISTANCE ATOMS=1,100 LABEL=d1

# Example: Radius of gyration (uncomment and modify as needed)
